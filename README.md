step1--> install django version 2.2 , using pip


step2--> to create a project goto the directory where you want to make your project
         and hit command -->  django-admin startproject <PROJECT-NAME>
         <PROJECT-NAME> --->  a folder is created by this name (whichever you mention in the command above)
         and this folder contains all the configuration files that are necessary for any django project
         
step3--> now to run django server
         navigate to your project folder and hit command --->  python3 manage.py runserver   
         (in some case it will be --> python manage.py runserver)
         
         
after these three steps your development server will get started , now you have to make changes in the code so that you can implement your own ideas
